#' Test for enrichment or depletion of mutations in genomic regions

#' @description Aggregates mutations per group (optional) and performs enrichment depletion test
#' @param x Dataframe result from genomic_distribution() 
#' @param by Optional grouping variable, e.g. tissue type
#' @return Data.frame with the observed and expected number of mutations per genomic region per group (by) or sample
