#' Find transcriptional strand of base substitutions in vcf
#'
#' For the positions that are within gene bodies it is determined whether
#' the "C" or "T" base is on the same strand as the gene definition. (Since
#' by convention we regard base substitutions as C>X or T>X.)
#'
#' Base substitions on the same strand as the gene definitions are considered
#' untranscribed, and on the opposite strand of gene bodies as transcribed,
#' since the gene definitions report the coding or sense strand, which is
#' untranscribed.
#'
#' No strand information "-" is returned for base substitutions outside gene
#' bodies, or base substitutions that overlap with more than one gene body.
#'
#' @param vcf GRanges containing the VCF object
#' @param genes GRanges with gene bodies definitions including strand
#' information
#'
#' @return Character vector with transcriptional strand information with
#' length of vcf: "-" for positions outside gene bodies, "U" for
#' untranscribed/sense/coding strand, "T" for
#' transcribed/anti-sense/non-coding strand.

#' ## For this example we need our variants from the VCF samples, and
#' ## a known genes dataset.  See the 'read_vcf()' example for how to
#' ## load the VCF samples.

#' ## You can obtain the known genes from the UCSC hg19 dataset using

#' ## For this example, we preloaded the data for you:
