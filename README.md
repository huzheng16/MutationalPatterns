# Getting started

### Installation

This package is dependent on R version 3.3.0

Install and load devtools package

  ```{r}
  install.packages("devtools")
  library(devtools)
  ```
Install and load MutationalPatterns package

  ```{r}
  options(unzip = 'internal')
  install_github("CuppenResearch/MutationalPatterns")
  library(MutationalPatterns)
  ```

### Reference genome

1. List all available reference genomes (BSgenome)

  ```{r}
  library(BSgenome)
  available.genomes()
  ```
2. Download and load your reference genome of interest

  ```{r}
  ref_genome = "BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19"
  source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
  biocLite(ref_genome)
  library(ref_genome, character.only = T)
  ```
  
### Load base substitution data

This package is for the analysis of patterns in SNV data only, therefore the vcf files should not contain indel positions.

Find package base substitution example/test data
  ```{r}
  vcf_files = list.files(system.file("extdata", package="MutationalPatterns"), full.names = T)
  ```

Load a single vcf file
  ```{r}
  vcf = read_vcf(vcf_files[1], "sample1")
  ```

Load a list of vcf files
  ```{r}
  sample_names = c("colon1", "colon2", "colon3", "intestine1", "intestine2", "intestine3", "liver1", "liver2", "liver3")
  vcfs = read_vcf(vcf_files, sample_names, genome = "hg19")
  ```

Include relevant metadata in your analysis, e.g. donor id, cell type, age, tissue type, mutant or wild type
  ```{r}
  tissue = c("colon", "colon", "colon", "intestine", "intestine", "intestine", "liver", "liver", "liver")
  ```

### Make chromosome names uniform

Check if chromosome names in vcf(s) and reference genome are the same
  ```{r}
  all(seqlevels(vcfs[[1]]) %in% seqlevels(get(ref_genome)))
  ```

If not, rename the seqlevels to the UCSC standard
  ```{r}
  vcfs = lapply(vcfs, function(x) rename_chrom(x))
  ```
  
Select autosomal chromosomes
  ```{r}
  auto = extractSeqlevelsByGroup(species="Homo_sapiens", style="UCSC", group="auto")
  vcfs = lapply(vcfs, function(x) keepSeqlevels(x, auto))
  ```

#Analyses

## Mutation types

Retrieve base substitutions from vcf object as "REF>ALT"
  ```{r}
  get_muts(vcfs[[1]])
  ```
  
Retrieve base substitutions from vcf and convert to the 6 types of base substitution types that are distinguished by convention: C>A, C>G, C>T, T>A, T>C, T>G. For example, if the reference allele is G and the alternative allele is T (G>T), this functions returns the G:C>T:A mutation as a C>A mutation.
  ```{r}
  get_types(vcfs[[1]])
  ```
  
Retrieve the context (1 base upstream and 1 base downstream) of the positions in the vcf object from the reference genome.
  ```{r}
  get_mut_context(vcfs[[1]], ref_genome)
  ```

Retrieve the types and context of the base substitution types for all positions in the vcf object. For the base substitutions that are converted to the conventional base substitution types, the reverse complement of the context is returned.
  ```{r}
  get_type_context(vcfs[[1]], ref_genome)
  ```

Count mutation type occurences for one vcf object
  ```{r}
  type_occurences = mut_type_occurences(vcfs[1], ref_genome)
  ```

Count mutation type occurences for all samples in a list of vcf objects
  ```{r}
  type_occurences = mut_type_occurences(vcfs, ref_genome)
  ```

## Mutation spectrum

Plot mutation spectrum over all samples. Plots the mean relative contribution of each of the 6 base substitution types. Error bars indicate standard deviation over all samples. The n indicates the total number of mutations in the set.
  ```{r}
  plot_spectrum(type_occurences)
  ```

Plot mutation spectrum with distinction between C>T at CpG sites
  ```{r}
  plot_spectrum(type_occurences, CT = T)
  ```

Plot spectrum without legend
  ```{r}
  plot_spectrum(type_occurences, CT = T, legend = F)
  ```

  ![spectra1](https://github.com/CuppenResearch/MutationalPatterns/blob/develop/images/spectra1.png)


Plot spectrum for each tissue separately
  ```{r}
  plot_spectrum(type_occurences, by = tissue, CT = T)
  ```

Specify 7 colors for spectrum plotting
  ```{r}
  my_colors = c("pink", "orange", "blue", "lightblue", "green", "red", "purple")
  plot_spectrum(type_occurences, CT = T, legend = T, colors = my_colors)
  ```

  ```{r}
  url = "http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cancergenome/assets/signatures_probabilities.txt"
  cancer_signatures = read.table(url, sep = "\t", header = T)

  ```

Fit mutation matrix to cancer signatures. This function finds the optimal linear combination of mutation signatures that most closely reconstructs the mutation matrix by solving nonnegative least-squares constraints problem

  ```{r}
  fit_res = fit_to_signatures(mut_matrix, cancer_signatures)
  # select signatures with some contribution
  select = which(rowSums(fit_res$contribution) > 0)
  # plot contribution
  plot_contribution(fit_res$contribution[select,], cancer_signatures[,select], coord_flip = F, mode = "absolute")

## Transcriptional strand bias analysis

For the mutations within genes it can be determined whether the mutation is on the transcribed or non-transcribed strand, which is interesting to study involvement of transcription-coupled repair. To this end, it is determined whether the "C" or "T" base (since by convention we regard base substitutions as C>X or T>X) are on the same strand as the gene definition. Base substitions on the same strand as the gene definitions are considered "untranscribed", and on the opposite strand of gene bodies as transcribed, since the gene definitions report the coding or sense strand, which is untranscribed. No strand information is reported for base substitution that overlap with more than one gene body.

Find gene definitions for your reference genome.

  ```{r}
  # get knowngenes table from UCSC for hg19
  biocLite("TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene")
  library("TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene")
  genes_hg19 = genes(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene)
  ```
  
Get transcriptional strand information for all positions in vcf 1. "Base substitions on the same strand as the gene definitions are considered. "-" for positions outside gene bodies, "U" for untranscribed/sense/coding strand, "T" for transcribed/anti-sense/non-coding strand.

  ```{r}
  get_strand(vcfs[[1]], genes_hg19)
  ```

Make mutation count matrix with transcriptional strand information (96 trinucleotides * 2 strands = 192 features). NB: only those mutations that are located within gene bodies are counted.

  ```{r}
  mut_mat_s = mut_matrix_stranded(vcfs, ref_genome, genes_hg19)
  ```
  
Perform strand bias analysis

  ```{r}
  strand_counts = strand_occurences(mut_mat_s, by=tissue)
  strand_plot = plot_strand(strand_counts, mode = "relative")
  ```

Perform poisson test for strand asymmetry significance testing

  ```{r}
  strand_bias = strand_bias_test(strand_counts)
  strand_bias_plot = plot_strand_bias(strand_bias)
  ```
  
  ![strand](https://github.com/CuppenResearch/MutationalPatterns/blob/develop/images/strand.png)  

  
## Extract signatures with strand bias


  ```{r}
  # extract 2 signatures
  nmf_res_strand = extract_signatures(mut_mat_s, rank = 2)
  
  # provide signature names (optional)
  colnames(nmf_res_strand$signatures) = c("Signature A", "Signature B")
  # plot signatures with 192 features
  plot_192_profile(nmf_res_strand$signatures)
  
  # plot strand bias per mutation type for each signature with significance test
  plot_signature_strand_bias(nmf_res_strand$signatures)
  ```

## Rainfall plot

A rainfall plot visualizes mutation types and intermutation distance. Rainfall plots can be used to visualize the distribution of mutations along the genome or a subset of chromosomes. The y-axis corresponds to the distance of a mutation with the previous mutation and is log10 transformed. Drop-downs from the plots indicate clusters or "hotspots" of mutations.

Make rainfall plot of sample 1 over all autosomal chromosomes
  ```{r}
  # define autosomal chromosomes
  chromosomes = seqnames(get(ref_genome))[1:22]
  # make rainfall plot
  plot_rainfall(vcfs[[1]], title = names(vcfs[1]), ref_genome = ref_genome, chromosomes = chromosomes, cex = 1.5)

  ```

  ![rainfall1](https://github.com/CuppenResearch/MutationalPatterns/blob/develop/images/rainfall1.png)
  
Make rainfall plot of sample 1 over chromosome 1

  ```{r}
  chromosomes = seqnames(get(ref_genome))[1]
  plot_rainfall(vcfs[[1]], title = names(vcfs[1]), ref_genome = ref_genome, chromosomes = chromosomes[1], cex = 2)
  ```

## Enrichment or depletion of mutations in genomic regions

Test for enrichment or depletion of mutations in certrain genomic regions, such as promoters, CTCF binding sites and transcription factor binding sites. To use your own genomic region definitions (based on e.g. ChipSeq experiments) specify your genomic regions in a named list of GRanges objects. Alternatively, use publically available genomic annotation data, like in the example below.

### Example: regulation annotation data from Ensembl using biomaRt

Install and load biomaRt package

  ```{r}
  source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
  biocLite("biomaRt")
  library(biomaRt)
  ```

  ```{r}
  mart="ensembl"
  # list datasets available from ensembl for hg19 = GrCh37
  listDatasets(useEnsembl(biomart="regulation", GRCh = 37))
  ```

  ```{r}
  # Multicell regulatory features
  regulation_regulatory = useEnsembl(biomart="regulation", dataset="hsapiens_regulatory_feature", GRCh = 37)
  # list all possible filters
  listFilters(regulation_regulatory)
  # list all posible output attributes
  listAttributes(regulation_regulatory)
  # list all filter options for a specific attribute
  filterOptions("regulatory_feature_type_name", regulation_regulatory)
  ```

Download data from Ensembl using biomaRt

  ```{r}
  # Promoters
  promoter = getBM(attributes = c('chromosome_name', 'chromosome_start', 'chromosome_end', 'feature_type_name'), 
                   filters = "regulatory_feature_type_name", 
                   values = "Promoter", 
                   mart = regulation_regulatory)
  promoter_g = reduce(GRanges(promoter$chromosome_name, IRanges(promoter$chromosome_start, promoter$chromosome_end)))
  
    # Promoter flanking regions
    promoter_flanking = getBM(attributes = c('chromosome_name', 'chromosome_start', 'chromosome_end', 'feature_type_name'), 
                filters = "regulatory_feature_type_name", 
                values = "Promoter Flanking Region", 
                mart = regulation_regulatory)
  promoter_flanking_g = reduce(GRanges(promoter_flanking$chromosome_name, IRanges(promoter_flanking$chromosome_start, promoter_flanking$chromosome_end))) 
  
  # CTCF binding sites
  CTCF = getBM(attributes = c('chromosome_name', 'chromosome_start', 'chromosome_end', 'feature_type_name', 'cell_type_name'), 
                filters = "regulatory_feature_type_name", 
                values = "CTCF Binding Site", 
                mart = regulation_regulatory)
  # convert to GRanges object
  CTCF_g = reduce(GRanges(CTCF$chromosome_name, IRanges(CTCF$chromosome_start, CTCF$chromosome_end))) 
  
  # Open chromatin
  open = getBM(attributes = c('chromosome_name', 'chromosome_start', 'chromosome_end', 'feature_type_name'), 
                filters = "regulatory_feature_type_name", 
                values = "Open chromatin", 
                mart = regulation_regulatory)
  open_g = reduce(GRanges(open$chromosome_name, IRanges(open$chromosome_start, open$chromosome_end))) 
  

  # Transcription factor binding sites
  TF_binding = getBM(attributes = c('chromosome_name', 'chromosome_start', 'chromosome_end', 'feature_type_name'), 
                            filters = "regulatory_feature_type_name", 
                            values = "TF binding site", 
                            mart = regulation_regulatory)
  TF_binding_g = reduce(GRanges(TF_binding$chromosome_name, IRanges(TF_binding$chromosome_start, TF_binding$chromosome_end))) 
  ```

Combine all genomic regions (GRanges objects) in a named list.

  ```{r}
  # combine all genomic regions in one regions list object
  regions = list(promoter_g, promoter_flanking_g, CTCF_g, open_g, TF_binding_g)
  # provide names
  names(regions) = c("Promoter", "Promoter flanking", "CTCF", "Open chromatin", "TF binding")
  # rename chromosomes to UCSC standard
  regions = lapply(regions, function(x) rename_chrom(x))
  ```

## Test for significant depletion or enrichment in genomic regions

It is necessary to include a list with Granges of regions that were surveyed in your analysis for each sample, that is: positions in the genome at which you have enough high quality reads to call a mutation. This can for example be determined using CallableLoci tool by GATK. If you would not include the surveyed area in your analysis, you might for example see a depletion of mutations in a certain genomic region that is solely a result from a low coverage in that region, and therefore does not represent an actual depletion of mutations.

  ```{r}
  # Read example file with surveyed/callable regions
  surveyed_file = list.files(system.file("bed", package="MutationalPatterns"), full.names = T)
  # read bed file as granges object
  surveyed_list = bed_to_granges(surveyed_file, "surveyed_all")
  # for this example we use the same surveyed file for each sample
  surveyed_list= rep(surveyed_list, 9)
  ```
Test for an enrichment or depletion of mutations in your defined genomic regions using a binomial test. For this test, the chance of observing a mutation is calculated as the total number of mutations, divided by the total number of surveyed bases.
  
  ```{r}
  # for each sample calculate the number of observed and expected number of mutations in each genomic regions
  distr = genomic_distribution(vcfs, surveyed_list, regions)
  # test for significant enrichment or depletion in the genomic regions
  # samples can be collapsed into groups, here the analysis is performed per tissue type
  distr_test = enrichment_depletion_test(distr, by = tissue)
  # plot enrichment depletion test results
  plot_enrichment_depletion(distr_test)
  ```
